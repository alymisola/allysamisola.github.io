        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <br>
        <h2>Visual Identity</h2>
        <p id="exp">One of the first steps that I considered in the design process was the Smithsonian Visual Brand guide. Below is
            a glimpse of their established brand guidelines.</p>

        <!-- Wireframes -->
        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p id="exp">As the UX/UI designer I first began designing low-fidelity wireframes prior to finalizing the high-fidelity prototypes.</p>

        <!-- Feedback -->
        <h2>Feedback + Iterations + Testing</h2>
        <p id="exp">Using the feedback received from my team and our mentor for the hackathon I thought about how we can not only continue 
            engagement between colleagues during the pandemic, but also how individuals can continue using the mobile platform. 
            What keeps our users of the app engaged? How do we increase longevity of use?</p>

        <!-- Strategies -->
        <h2>Engagement Standings</h2>
        <p id="exp">This creates a friendly competition amongst colleagues while at home. The gamification aspect would help with the continuous
            use of the mobile app as it sparks the competitiveness between individuals, especially when you are recognized for your efforts.
        </p>

        <!-- <p id="exp">By the end of the process, the UI of the app changed. Changes were made to improve clarity and consistency with the 
            Smithsonian brand. Through each iteration, I was able to focus on my visual design skills and learn more about hierarchy, 
            information architecture, and gesture patterns that younger demographics may be familiar with. </p> -->

        <!-- Reflection -->
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p id="exp"><b>There are more pressing challenges individuals are facing aside from the lack of in-person interactions during the pandemic.</b> 
            Although our mobile app and solution solves the problem regarding the lack of employee collaborations and interactions when remote, 
            it does not directly support the frontline workers or improve healthcare as stated in the brief. </p>

        <p id="exp"><b>It was and continues to be very challenging to design a solution for a global event that is still ongoing and ever-changing.</b> 
            We all were not prepared for a pandemic to occur however, ensuring to conduct user testing and interviews truly helped with the feedback 
            and validation of our solution. This gives us an opportunity to branch out and determine how else we can fight the pandemic aside from apps.</p>
