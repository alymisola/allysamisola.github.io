        <h2>Innovation Technology Team</h2>

        <p id="exp">This Spring term of 2020, I worked as an Innovative Technology Intern and UX/Product 
            designer at <br> <i id="extra">Canada’s largest retail company.</i><br><br>

            Loblaw Companies Limited is a Canadian food retailer that 
            also hold numerous business units and banners which includes apparel, pharmacy, 
            and the company’s own banking. Loblaw Companies Limited has <i id="extra">over 200,000 individuals</i>
            working in the frontlines and corporate offices in various business units; from market 
            stores, wholesalers, pharmaceuticals, finance and most recently, express delivery – 
            Loblaw continues their innovative growth.<br><br>
            
            I was fortunate enough to work in the company’s 
            business unit called <i id="extra">Loblaw Technology for the Innovation Technology team; a 14-person 
            Tech Innovation unit</i> that evaluates digital properties and research technology trends to 
            recommend and implement at Loblaw stores across Canada.<br><br>
            
            I was one of three Innovation interns that focused on the business units’ challenges, utilizing user experience research 
            and prototyping, to find appropriate digital and technological assets as store solutions, 
            to <i id="extra">fight COVID-19, protect our customers, front-line colleagues and future proof Loblaw stores.</i>
        </p>

        <h2>My Corporate Family</h2>

        <p id="exp">Loblaw Technology was the <i id="extra">first established organization, in a corporate environment, I
            fortunately worked in</i>, it was also the <i id="extra">first remote job I had</i> – nevertheless, the Innovation Team
            did not fall short in making the interns, like myself, feel welcomed and learn their utmost. The
            company truly changed my approach and establish my expected future work environment.<br><br>

            My Innovation Team ensured we interns
            were learning, comfortable and accomplishing the goals we have outlined for ourselves
            throughout the term. They made every process enjoyable and educational – I am proud to call
            many of my colleagues both a friend and a mentor.<br><br>
            
            Although I was only an intern of three, my team and leads expressed to us that we were <i id="extra">wholeheartedly part 
            of the team.</i> Regardless of our knowledge (or lack of) about the work or the skills we have yet to hone
            or learn, we are as equally important and able as our fulltime colleagues – they trusted our
            opinions, ideas, and trusted us to conduct presentations for Loblaw company directors and
            stakeholders and lead proejcts that would help with our skills. <i id="extra">We were prone to mistakes and challenges, but we were given the chance to
            independently learn and ask for necessary assistance.</i><br><br>

            Loblaw Technology truly taught me the importance of teamwork, trust and mentorship. LT truly established my
            idea of an ideal workplace!
