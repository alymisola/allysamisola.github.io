            construction or lacking information needed. In addition to that, there are many 
            overlapping images and contents making the overall website not as visually-appealing.

            making their items. My team and I personally liked how they are bold with thier photos;
            minimal words, more emphasis on their clothing thus bigger sized images to show their 
            product. A Canadian online investment management service focused on millennials. Not
            only do they provide smart and simple investing, but their website also shows their
            simplicity and minimalist style that we also gravitated to.

        <h3><b style="color:#BF8BEC">Final thoughts</b></h3>
        <h2 style="color:#49B7A0">Designing</h2>
        <p id="exp">After reviewing each team members design thoroughly, we concluded that it would be best to take certain elements from 
            each design. Overall from the mockups we discovered some keys changes that needed to be addressed in the redesign: Navigation, 
            Content and Aesthetics. The product page was an area that lacked the most, ultimately there was a consensus that there needed 
            to be a filter system to improve the usability of the page and a grid layout for the overall design.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p id="exp">Aesthetically we decided to go with a more neutral palette of pastels and earth tones that was featured in one of group
            members designs, along with the style of buttons, and finishings that she had used. Another common thread in each of our designs
            was a slideshow on the homepage featuring a welcome from the company, their slogan and information about sales and events,
            therefore we carried that into our final design and choose the fonts and images collectively.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p id="exp">We came to the consensus that the website needed to be modern and minimal with a relative colour palette to the nature
            of the business, but also one that did not detract from the vibrancy of the products. We fixed the existing navigation issues
            through the use of a navigation bar that carried through each page and in page links to more information. Finally we addressed
            the content issues by adding the missing information and expanding on that which was originally provided, and through the use
            of a footer the most pertinent information is always easily accessible to the customers.
