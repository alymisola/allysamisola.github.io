        <!-- Overview -->
        <h3><b style="color:#8DC36F">Overview</b></h3>
        <h2 style="color:#F1A06B">Background</h2>

        <p id="exp">On March 15th the University of Waterloo’s St. Paul’s College hosted an Environmental Design Challenge. 
            This event was sponsored by Environmental and Climate Change Canada. ECCC developed their Pollution Prevention 
            (P2) Resource Finder; it is described as “Canada's one-stop database of online pollution prevention resources.”
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2 style="color:#F1A06B">P2 Finder Paint Point</h2>

        <p id="exp">The P2 finder enables individuals to find practical pollution prevention tips, tools, and guidance to 
            make more sustainable choices in their everyday life. It includes articles and small “hacks” that eliminate waste 
            and encourages sustainability. The P2 finder can be accessed on the Government of Canada website, but it can still 
            be inaccessible due to the update of our technologies and ways of accessing information.

        <h2 style="color:#F1A06B">Target</h2>

        <p id="exp">As the challenge outlined the importance of “youth participation” we thought that the “youth” is a large 
            and vague market. We decided to focus on a specific kind of youth where they are in the middle of learning to live
            an independent life, turning their focus not only their education but their well-being – university students 
            residing on campus (residents).
        </p>

        <img id="edits" src="imagesUI/pulito/students.jfif">
        <br>
        <p id="exp">As university students ourselves, we are constantly learning how to become independent and continuously try
             to find ‘hacks’ to make our everyday lives easier. If we targeted individuals who are always curious and in a time
             of their lives where they are figuring things out, we can help them develop good habits especially in the realm of
             pollution prevention choices.

        <h2 style="color:#F1A06B">Student values</h2>

        <p id="exp">From further reserach personal experiences, there are five things that the student market values the most:
            <ul>
                <li class="facts">1. Receiving fairly good passsing grades</li>
                <li class="facts">2. Having friendly competition with fellow classmates and peers</li>
                <li class="facts">3. Being aware current trends and events on campus</li>
                <li class="facts">4. Shock factor (sometimes the unexpected has positive outcomes!)</li>

        <p id="exp">Pokemon Go uses augmented reality for users to play the game while interacting their surroundings. 
            This makes users more active and willing to go outside as all as collaborate with other app users to complete a challenge. 
            Pokemon Go's interactivity with one's surroundings inspired my team and I to also integrate that into our solution.

        <p id="exp">We personally navigated through the P2 website and read the articles provided pollution prevention activities
            as well that we can possibly incorporate into the P2 app. We understand the market as WE are the market, we used our
            personal experiences (as students) and compared what pollution prevention choices we’ve made and continuously make we
            had Felix, our teammate and former don / student leader; share his experience living in a residence as a don and the
            influence he has, simply because he is a student lead.

        <h2 style="color:#F1A06B">Takeaways</h2>
        <p id="exp">The EDC challenge was a very fun experience overall; I’ve learned that we have many pollution preventions options
            to choose from that can help make a difference no matter how small they are. This design challenge helped me understand and
            realize the many resources we have available to us, it’s only a matter of its ease of accessibility and legibility. No matter
            how much information we’d like to include within our app or we will be including when integrating P2.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2 style="color:#F1A06B">Designing</h2>
        <p id="exp">Two words: Design Systems! Sometimes being in the thick of the competition, you get lost in the challenge, designing 
            whatever “looks good” rather than what works best for the user. When we began designing the app, I started to go haywire! From 
            the navigation bar to what kind of button it should have or whether it should have an off shadow with the images, pointless 
            design thinking because I was really focused on how it looked rather than its system. I ended up creating screens that were not 
            needed and did not pertain to our idea, the UIs became inconsistent! We learned the importance of having a solid design system 
            to follow so that we do not forget any screens or make unnecessary ones.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2 style="color:#F1A06B">Next steps</h2>
        <p id="exp">As we continuously create and innovate, we also continue to mindlessly make pollutive choices – we hope to integrate 
            Pulito or something of a similar application and practice in our everyday lives soon. We hope to involve more stakeholders for 
            research, testing and design phases as well as explore more design solutions to guarantee its use and reliability. We hope to 
            expand our market from University or College Residence to families (at home challenges, family-based) and then to an industry 
            of some sort such as competition between restaurants etc.
