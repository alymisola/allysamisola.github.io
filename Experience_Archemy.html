                students understand chemical interactions by using tactile AR markers
                to simulate molecular bonds in a 3D digital environment.</i>

            <p id="exp">
                We all thought VR was fun to play, but we also thought:
                how can we use VR as a form of learning in this innovative
                economy we live in? We are a team of designers, researchers,
                professors and learners. We are advocate for education and students’
                ease of learning especially.

            <h2>Our current work</h2>

            <p id="exp">
                We use AR/VR and Virtual Reality headsets such as: Google Cardboard & Daydream
                and Oculus Go & Quest, to teach concepts, theories and conduct mock experiments
                in STEM-related courses to ease the learning of students in one of the many challenging
                courses taken in post-secondary. 
                <!-- The VR space will mimic a real-life laboratory (from their
                university or college) for students to get comfortable in the space and be familiarize with
                the experiments and lab assignments they will be eventually conducting after a lesson. -->

                <b>Learn Effectively |</b> Virtual reality has been used for over
                40 years in higher level education and industrial training. In many
                cases virtual reality training content has provided significantly
                higher test scores with users. REF#.
                <br><br>
                <b>Efficient Teaching |</b> Using virtual simulations, you can show 
                students visual representations of hard to understand processes. 
                VR also allows users to complete tasks in safe digital environments 
                to reinforce learning tasks.
                <br><br>
                <b>Reduce Training Time |</b> Provide safety training, medical training 
                and distance learning at a fraction of real-world costs with digital objects 
                and immersive environments. Save on travel, equipment and insurance costs 
                as well as many more unseen costs associated with physical training days.
                <br><br>
                <b>Reduce Distractions |</b> Virtual reality enables students and colleagues 
                to become fully immersed in the chosen environment and subject material and 
                reduce distractions from the outside world. The ability to reduce distractions 
                using VR provides a more focused and personal learning experience.

                <b>Technology Based |</b> VR headsets such as: Oculus Quest, Oculus Go, and Google
                Daydream are being used for prototypes and will be determined which headset is the
                best for the final product.

            <h2>User packages</h2>

            <p id="exp">
                I initiated the Post and Pre-user testing questions to determine how we will be 
                approaching the user-testing phase. The Pre-user questions would help determine 
                their year, program, school, type of courese they are taking (in STEM), their 
                learning styles and what VR or AR experience they have. The Post-testing questions 
                will be useful for when we are ready to test the A/B protytpe of our product and 
                for after our users have tested out product; this would help us determining what 
                VR headset, with the accompanying remotes, is most ideal.

                comfortable they were with the lessons beings taught, how engaged or interested were 
                they in the course and how it reflected in their deliverables. Understanding the learning
                styles of majority of STEM students would help us better design our VR lessons to the 
                users. Majority of students are visual and kinesthetic learners meaning images, tangible 
                objects and carrying out physical activities is more effective than listening to lectures.

            <h2>Sense of sight</h2>

            <p id="exp">
                We wanted this product to be user-centric and focused on all learning types. Our biggest 
                challenge that we are currently attempting to alleviate is creating a meaningful learning 
                experience for students with accessibility issues. I researched the AODA and read about their 
                accessibility standards to apply to the product. I wanted to first start with the most common 
                accessibility matter to hopefully improve within our product which is regarding sight. As a 
                student, learner and ordinary person, our sense of sight it the most used, however, there are 
                many cases where individuals have sight impediments that stops them from having the full 
                experience of the product. As our learning experience being the most important aspect within 
                our product we want to make sure our concepts and lessons are clear and easy to see and visualize 
                in a VR space.

            <h2>Patterns and colours</h2>

            <p id="exp">
                Approaching this pain point, I decided to look into ways of how to make the sense of sight less 
                of a challenge or pain point and more of a fun additional asset! Trello boards were my inspiration. 
                Trello, a list-making application, that contains boards, lists, and cards to organize and prioritize 
                your projects in a fun, flexible, and rewarding way. One of the greatest features of Trello is their 
                colored & patterned tags to help further organize one's action or task card. We always associate colors 
                with organization but not everyone can use colors to their advantage due to color blindess and other 
                forms of sight impairement that hinders their seeing of colors. Using shapes and patterns are the next 
                most useful method in organization; everyone can see and determine shapes and outlines that even without 
                colors, the shapes and outlines are still clear in sight.

            <h2>Ball and stick activity</h2>

            <p id="exp">
                In chemistry, the ball-and-stick model is a molecular model of a chemical substance which is to display both
                the three-dimensional position of the atoms and the bonds between them. The atoms are typically represented 
                by spheres, connected by rods which represent the bonds. I wanted to incorperate this method into this activity 
                to help individuals determine which molecular model is needed to create a chemical bond outlined in their lesson 
                or assignments. Such atoms are determined by color as seen in text-books and in physical models, they also vary 
                in size but that still does not help with differentiating each atom. I decided to incorperate Trello's color & 
                pattern method into our atom or molecule legend in the VR space; this is so that when users are completing the 
                activity, they can refer to the legend and easily determine which chemical atom is needed to create a particular 
                bond.

            <h2>Current research</h2>

            <p id="exp">
                We created possible solutions for individuals who have impaired sight as it is the most common accessibility challenge: 
                many have colorblindness and such subjects often use colors to differentiate and label specific parts and materials. 
                This is done by using patterns to also label materials, in this case, specific chemical atoms such as Hydrogen, Oxygen 
                etc. Not only are these atoms colored appropriately but they also have specific patterns on the atoms to characterize 
                its chemical.

            <p id="exp">
                This is an on-going project that my colleagues and I will continue to improve to finally share with everyone. 
                We believe the Virtual Reality industry can pioneer a new and effective way of learning: more engaging, interactive, 
                enjoyable and meaningful. We hope our product could be of help to students and professors beyond our local universities, 
                in the STEM programs with challenging courses such as Organic Chemistry and hopefully help individuals beyond STEM programs. 
                We are continuing the user research, transitioning from phase A (rendering the VR space) to B (creating learning activites 
                and scenarios in the VR space; more user-testing is on its way along with Archemy's future launch. <br><br>
