        <!-- Overview -->
        <h3><b style="color:#FE7C1E">Overview</b></h3>
        <h2 style="color:#1C33A7">Background</h2>

        <p id="exp">This was a User Research and Design school project for my Global Business and Digital Arts 103 course
            (User Experience Design). I chose to revisit this project as a personal design challenge for myself; upon learning 
            more about user research and design – I wanted to apply my knowledge and see if I can further improve the application, 
            solution, UI, and overall concept as it has potential in being used in real life especially as it pertains to individuals 
            with accessibility matters.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2 style="color:#1C33A7">Project</h2>

        <p id="exp">We are to explore and create digital solutions to help eliminate or improve pain points within our community.
            This project challenges our design thinking and keeps our focus on the end-user and the market we are targeting.
        </p>

            alleviate or possibly eliminate the daily challenges of individuals with 
            accessibility matters?</i></b></h3>

        <!-- Research -->
        <h3><b style="color:#FE7C1E">Research</b></h3>
        <h2 style="color:#1C33A7">Target</h2>

        <p id="exp">As the target market is very large, we wanted to focus on the more substantial part of the market, which is 
            the physical aspect of accessibility matters. We live in an “always-on-the-go” environment, that requires a lot of 
            movement, but for individuals with physical disabilities, it can be challenging for most to get around places especially 
            if such locations are not accessibility friendly.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2 style="color:#1C33A7">Interviews</h2>

        <p id="exp">We interviewed candidates who were willing to share their challenges when travelling to places in the town of 
            Stratford and get a picutre of thier day in a life with a physical disability. They also shared their input on how 
            transportation could be made easier for them.
            <ul>
                <li class="facts">1. Running Errands & Simple Hangouts are hard and awful Weather can make it harder</li>
                <li class="facts">2. Lack of Mobility Aid or Services plus, the buses get Packed & Full</li>
                <li class="facts">3. Lack of Information they can look to for Safety travels</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2 style="color:#1C33A7">Findings</h2>

        <p id="exp">This is what we found upon interviewing our candidates:
            <ul>
                <li class="facts">1. Disabilities are not always visible and it should not define them</li>
                <li class="facts">2. Human Interaction goes a long way! However, their independence should also be respected</li>
            </ul>

        <p id="exp">Google Maps provides the layout of roads, the locations of cities and towns, state boundaries, geographical features, 
            restaurant reviews and satellite images. Can help with finding Acessibility friendly routes, forms of transportation, 
            restaurants, parks, and other locations. Keeping track of your health and having a community within the app to provide information and their experiences 
            provides users a sense of comfort and ease. This would help keep track of the users' well-being, current health and overall safety. 
            This can be based on apps as myFitness Pal and Samsung Health App.

        <h3><b style="color:#FE7C1E">Final thoughts</b></h3>
        <h2 style="color:#1C33A7">Designing</h2>
        <p id="exp">Upon designing this app, we felt inconsistent with its process and solution thus posed many questions: 
            The main challenge being: how would a mobile app that also requires certain amount of motor skills to navigate 
            through be of help to individuals who are physically impaired? We wanted ease and comfort for users and not add 
            another routinely task to their daily life. The IoT aspect is very technical and expensive to implement, 
            especially since the IoT concept has not been solidified – this already pose many problems with regards to the user’s 
            independence and privacy.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2 style="color:#1C33A7">Next steps</h2>
        <p id="exp">Solidify idea and solution and ensure its proper use and benefits to the users as well as keep a user-centric design: 
            we would hopefully create a more secure solution that would not disclose any health information about the users to the public 
            even to private app users. Solidify the IoT integration within the app and make use of the concept to better help individuals 
            with accessibility issues!
